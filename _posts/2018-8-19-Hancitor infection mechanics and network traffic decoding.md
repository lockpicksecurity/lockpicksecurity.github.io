In this blog post I’ll show some analysis I did couple of months ago of a randomly picked Hancitor malware from the malware-traffic-analysis.net web site. The link to the PCAP can be found here.

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the infection mechanics and make sense of the traffic generated by the malware.

Looking at the PCAP file’s network connection statistics we can see there are 97 TCP and 9 UDP connections in total.
