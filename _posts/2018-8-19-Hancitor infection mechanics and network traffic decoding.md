In this blog post I'll show some analysis I did couple of months ago of a randomly picked Hancitor malware from the malware-traffic-analysis.net web site. The link to the PCAP can be found [here](http://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2018/01/29/index2.html).

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the infection mechanics and make sense of the traffic generated by the malware.

Looking at the PCAP file's network connection statistics we can see there are 97 TCP and 9 UDP connections in total.

The UDP traffic is o![3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/3.png)
nly domain name resolutions for some interesting web-sites.

The malware and its components seem to have resolved the following domain name addresses:
christs-ministries.com
api.ipify.org
gosandhegly.com
mail.voicesinprintpublishing.com
neubacher.at
waslohidi.ru
www.google.com

Now letâ€™s focus on the TCP connections by following the first stream in the PCAP file which shows us the traffic when a user clicks on the link in the phishing e-mail.
