Whether you need to forensically investigate a security incident or understand why certain event occurred, we can help you by applying our experience in dealing with complex digital investigations.


## Incident Response
We assist companies with security incidents they are experiencing on an Ad-hoc basis or  make sure their environments are breach free as part of our Incident Response retainer.

## Malware Analysis
Do you want to know if an executable or document file is created with a malicious intent? We can help you by inspecting the malware specimen's behaviour in our lab or reverse engineer it in order to understand its inner-workings. We will provide you with a human friendly interpretation of the deeply technical analysis results.

## Network Security Monitoring
We can increase the visibility in your environment by installing our network monitoring devices which will alert if malicious traffic is detected and store valuable network communication data to assist in further investigations. (in development)

## Compromise Assessment
Utilizing the experience accumulated over the years in fighting nation state adversaries, we can assess the health of your environment for any signs of ongoing or past security breaches. (in development)

## Adversary Deception
By combining technical and social based approaches in misleading potential or current threat actors, we can increase your chances in identifying ongoing attacks and misguide adversaries safely away from your organization's network. Adversaries' tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) will be studied and used to your advantage. (in development)
